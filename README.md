Sample Packages
===============
This repository contains examples of fully functional and tested plug-in source codes. These plug-ins only work on Arcadier's marketplaces which are on a **Growth**, **Scale**, or **Enterprise** plans.
***

Languages
---------
Since our Marketplaces are web apps, these plug-ins are coded in 
* HTML 5
* CSS 
* JavaScript

Our server-side language is in PHP.
***

File Structure
--------------
As explained in our [Plug-in documentation](#), the file structure of each Plug-in's source code is very specific and is reflected in this repository. For example, the honestbee plug in has `honestbee` as root, with 2 subfolders `admin` and `user`. 

`admin` contains the part of the code that executes for the marketplace administrator. `user` has the code that executes for the merchants and buyers.
